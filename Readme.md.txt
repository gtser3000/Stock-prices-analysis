This Jupyter Notebook is designed to analyze historical stock prices for multiple companies. It includes functionality to download stock data, calculate correlations, visualize trends, and perform advanced financial analyses such as rolling volatility and Bollinger Bands.

Features
1. Data Download
Downloads historical stock data for specified tickers using the yfinance library.
Saves the data to CSV files for future use.
2. Data Visualization
Plots closing prices for multiple stocks to visualize trends over time.
Generates heatmaps to show pairwise correlations between stock prices and returns.
3. Statistical Analysis
Calculates pairwise correlations between stock prices.
Computes rolling volatility for each stock to analyze risk over time.
Implements Bollinger Bands to identify price trends and potential trading signals.
4. Advanced Analysis
Performs year-over-year percentage change analysis for stock prices.
Calculates rolling correlations for returns and volatilities.
Conducts Engleâ€“Granger cointegration tests to identify long-term relationships between stock pairs.
Creates animated rolling correlation heatmaps to visualize evolving relationships over time.
